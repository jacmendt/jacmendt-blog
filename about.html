			Right now I am working at the [Saxony State and University Library (SLUB)](http://www.slub-dresden.de/startseite/) in Dresden as a Web Developer and
			Geoinformatics guy. Beside that I'm working part time as Consultant for [TK-Geoinformatik](http://tk-geoinformatik.de/). My main areas of interest are
			Spatial Data Infrastructures, Web Development and Sensor Networks. I am also quite involved in topics regarding the Web of Things as well as the creation of sensor web applications. When I'm not working I really like to play Basketball and do some Music.

			This blog is build thanks to great template [centrarium](https://github.com/bencentra/centrarium) by [bencentra](http://bencentra.com).
