			Right now I am working at the <strong><a href="http://www.slub-dresden.de/startseite/">Saxony State and University Library (SLUB)</a></strong>
			in Dresden as a Web Developer and Geoinformatics guy. Beside that I'm working part time as Consultant for
			<strong><a href="http://tk-geoinformatik.de/">TK-Geoinformatik</a></strong>. My main areas of interest are
			Spatial Data Infrastructures, Web Development and Sensor Networks. I am also quite involved in topics regarding
			the Web of Things as well as the creation of sensor web applications. When I'm not working I really like to play Basketball and
			do some Music.
